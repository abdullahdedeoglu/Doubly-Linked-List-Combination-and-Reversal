# Doubly-Linked-List-Combination-and-Reversal
This C program manipulates two separate doubly linked lists, combines them into one, and then reverses the resultant linked list.
# Functionality:
Create and Display Lists:
Generates two separate doubly linked lists with random integer values.
Displays both lists separately.

Combine Lists:
Combines the two lists into a single linked list while maintaining their original order.
The combined list is displayed after the operation.

Reverse List:
Reverses the combined linked list.
Displays the reversed list.

# Operations:
Create Lists:
Input the number of elements to generate for the lists.
Two separate linked lists will be created with random integer values.

Combine and Display:
Displays the two separate lists created initially.
Merges the lists into a single linked list while keeping their original order.
Displays the combined linked list.
Reverse Display:
Reverses the order of the combined linked list.
Displays the reversed linked list.

# File Structure:
20010011046_Odev2.c: C source file containing the implementation of list creation, combination, and reversal.
README.md: Documentation file explaining the functionalities and how to use the program.

# Usage:
Compile:
Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc -o linkedlist linkedlist_combination.c).
Run:
Execute the compiled program (./linkedlist in Linux/Mac or linkedlist.exe in Windows).
Follow Instructions:
Input the number of elements to generate for the lists.
Follow the on-screen instructions to view the lists, the combined list, and the reversed list.

# Notes:
The program generates two doubly linked lists with random integer values.
It combines these lists into a single linked list while preserving their individual orders.
After combination, the program reverses the order of the combined linked list.

# Potential Enhancements:
Additional functionalities like inserting elements, deleting elements, or sorting the linked list can be implemented for further versatility.
# Dependencies:
C compiler (e.g., GCC for Linux/Mac or MinGW for Windows)
